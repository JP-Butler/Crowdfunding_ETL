# Crowdfunding_ETL
Through a partner collaboration, this project builds upon an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and PostgreSQL for extracting, transforming, and loading crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database.

# Background
In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. We then loaded the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.
